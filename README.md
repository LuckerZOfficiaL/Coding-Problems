# Coding-Problems

This is a repository where I share my solutions to *LeetCode* problems. In each .py file there is a problem statement and some personal comment from me. 
The names of the problems are the same as the names of the original problems on the website. The solutions are not heavily focused on optimization. 
Sometimes there can be easy optimizations that I just did't bother making. I'm busy :)

If, by chance, you go through my code and see improvement I can make, you are pleased to reach out to me and share your feedback. That means a lot to me.

Thank you for being here!
